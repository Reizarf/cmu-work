// An (approximately) 11:1 voltage divider (931K : 95.3K) is connected to
// an Arduino analog GPIO input pin.  The ADC converter is set to use
// the internal constant 2.56 volt reference source when doing ADC
// conversions. The ADC divides the 0.0 to 2.56 volt range into 1023
// equally spaced integer intervals. This means an input voltage in the
// range 0.0 to 28.2 (11 x 2.56) volts can be measured to an approximate
// accuracy of 0.027 (28.2 / 1023) volts (or 27.5 millivolts).  This is
// good enough for the type of work done in this course.  It also allows
// measuring most DC voltages encountered in this course without having
// to switch measurement scales.

// The Arduino analog GPIO pin has a maximum rated input voltage of 5.5
// volts.  Because of the voltage divider, it would require the voltmeter
// input to be connected to a 60.5 (5.5 x 11) volt source before damage
// to the Arduino would occur.  Even though this is unlikely, a 5.1 volt
// Zener diode is connected between the GPIO pin and ground.  Should the
// input voltage exceed 56.1 (5.1 x 11), the Zener diode will clamp the
// GPIO pin voltage to 5.1 volts, providing overvoltage protection.
// The Zener diode also protects against negative input voltages (which
// can also damage the GPIO pin if excessive).  If a negative input
// voltage is applied, the Zener diode will clamp to -0.7 volts, which
// won't damage the Arduino.
